                    Grinnell College offers undergraduate research opportunities through a
                    program called Mentored Advance Projects. This project focused on developing a statistics-based
                    education game for use
                    in university intro and advanced courses. The game has had more than 300 students use it in
                    statistics labs at universities such as
                    West Point and Grinnell College.

                <p class="card-text">
                    A website developed in Software Development and Design class at Grinnell College. The project
                    involved working
                    with Imagine Grinnell to plan, develop, and maintain a website with the goal of providing townsfolk
                    with more information
                    on the various giving gardens available throughout town. My work included creation of databases to
                    track users, admins,
                    and produce/garden data.

                <p class="card-text">
                    A paper written after conducting research and field study in Cuba, Costa Rica, and Denmark.
                    The paper analyzes the influence of out-of-pocket payments on healthcare systems. The research
                    process
                    included visitations to hospitals, primary care clinics, and rural communities. Interviews were
                    conducted with
                    medical practictioners and an assortment of patients with various backgrounds and identities.

                <p class="card-text">
                    An application built to give people a simple way to keep track of their food purchases and the expiration
                    status of their food. Given a product a user might wish to buy, the app searches for the product's
                    expiration date and sets up a calendar/notification to alert users if they haven't used up their
                    food as the expiration date gets closer. After the user has trained the app with sufficient data
                    based on their average rate of consumption of certain products, the app is also designed to make
                    intelligent suggestions on how much of a certain product a user should buy to avoid over purchasing.
                    It was developed during one of my first Hackathons.
