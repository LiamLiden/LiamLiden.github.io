                <p class="card-text">
                    A game created at the DIS Game Jam 2020 over a period of 24 hours. The theme of the jam was "One Button". The game is designed 
                    around each player having one button that allows them to jump over obstacles. Each player's button changes 
                    after they press it, causing them to have to wrestle and fight for buttons around the keyboard.

                <p class="card-text">
                    Grinnell College offers undergraduate research opportunities through a
                    program called Mentored Advance Projects. This project focused on developing a statistics-based
                    education game for use
                    in university intro and advanced courses. The game has had more than 300 students use it in
                    statistics labs at universities such as
                    West Point and Grinnell College.

                <p class="card-text">
                    A website developed in Software Development and Design class at Grinnell College. The project
                    involved working
                    with Imagine Grinnell to plan, develop, and maintain a website with the goal of providing townsfolk
                    with more information
                    on the various giving gardens available throughout town. My work included creation of databases to
                    track users, admins,
                    and produce/garden data.

                    A paper created for an Econometrics class. The paper analyzes the effect of GDP, consumption, and income (per capita) on party affiliation of a
                    state. The paper was created to showcase our ability to utilize econometric models and ability to
                    create and interpret results based on data we've interpreted ourselves.

                <p class="card-text">
                    An application built to give people a simple way to keep track of their food purchases and the expiration
                    status of their food. Given a product a user might wish to buy, the app searches for the product's
                    expiration date and sets up a calendar/notification to alert users if they haven't used up their
                    food as the expiration date gets closer. After the user has trained the app with sufficient data
                    based on their average rate of consumption of certain products, the app is also designed to make
                    intelligent suggestions on how much of a certain product a user should buy to avoid over purchasing.
                    It was developed during over a 48 hour period during the ISU Hackathon.
